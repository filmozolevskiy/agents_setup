# Trello: Content Integration board

Use the **user-trello** MCP server. **Before each tool call**, read that tool’s JSON schema under `mcps/user-trello/tools/`. Prefer `set_active_board` once per session, then omit `boardId` where the API allows.

## Board and list (fixed)

| Item | ID |
|------|-----|
| Board **Content Integration** | `61d5cf784c6396541499e7ce` |
| List **Backlog** | `6509c593087340dfdd332b0a` |

**New cards:** always create with `add_card_to_list` on list `6509c593087340dfdd332b0a` (Backlog). Do not place new agent-created cards in Ready for Dev, In Progress, or other lists unless the user explicitly overrides.

**Updates:** use `update_card_details`, `move_card`, checklists, labels, and comments as needed. When updating, keep the card on its current list unless the user asks to move it.

**Archiving:** Use the `archive_card` tool to close or archive cards. Always add a descriptive comment (e.g., "Project stopped", "Duplicate of X") before archiving.

## Deduplication and related cards (before creating)

**Do not add a new card** until you have checked the board for work that already tracks the **same change or fix**.

1. `set_active_board` (this board), then `get_lists`.
2. Fetch cards from every **active-work** list: **Backlog**, **Ready for Dev**, **In Progress**, **Blocked**, **Staging**, **Fixes needed**, **Ready for Deployment**, **QA**, **QA Tracking 👀**, **Parking**, **On hold**, **Done**, and **Archive**. Skip **INFORMATION** (dashboard/meta). Use `get_cards_by_list_id` per list.
3. **Robust searching and filtering:** For large boards, JSON outputs from `get_cards_by_list_id` can be huge. Use the provided Python script for reliable filtering instead of complex shell pipelines.
   - Script: `.cursor/skills/trello_content_integration/scripts/filter_cards.py`
   - It parses real JSON (via `json.load`) — pass the MCP output files explicitly, or pipe via stdin.
   - **Invocation (explicit files, preferred):**
     ```bash
     python3 .cursor/skills/trello_content_integration/scripts/filter_cards.py \
       --terms "keyword1" "keyword2" \
       --exclude "listID1" "listID2" \
       -- path/to/cards_backlog.json path/to/cards_ready_for_dev.json
     ```
   - **Invocation (stdin):** `... filter_cards.py --terms "keyword" < cards.json`
   - It accepts a top-level array or an object wrapping the array (handles minor MCP shape variations).
   - Output is one line per card: `name | url`, deduplicated, sorted by name.
   - **Prefer `url` over `shortUrl`:** the script already prefers `url` (slug-bearing) and falls back to `shortUrl` only when `url` is absent.
4. **Match using:** same or obvious alias **title prefix** (e.g. `AMADEUS`, `RESPRO`), core keywords, carrier/office/GDS named in the request, booking ID, hash, or error text—compare both **card names** and, for candidates, `get_card` **descriptions** (`includeMarkdown`: true when useful).
5. **Outcomes:**
   - **Same change / duplicate:** Do **not** create a new card. Tell the user which card(s) already cover it (use each card’s `shortUrl` / `url`). Offer to **add** the user’s new examples, queries, or links via **`add_comment`** on that card or **`update_card_details`** on the description, instead of opening a duplicate.
   - **No duplicate but similar / overlapping:** Create the card (still Backlog) **and** note overlaps as **one or two bullets** under `⊙ **Numbers/ quantity/ Examples:**` (e.g. `Related: [title](shortUrl) — same office, different error`). Do **not** add a large standalone “Related cards” section unless the user asks.
   - **No related cards found:** Proceed with creation; omit a “none found” line unless it helps the team.

When the user explicitly wants a **new** card even though a close duplicate exists (e.g. split scope), note the duplicate **under Numbers/ Examples** and explain the split in one short bullet.

## Card title (naming)

Match titles already used on this board:

- **`SOURCE_OR_AREA: Short concrete summary`** — `SOURCE` is usually the GDS / integration / product prefix in **ALL CAPS** (e.g. `AMADEUS`, `RESPRO`, `TRAVELFUSION`, `FLXNDC`, `PAYHUB`, `BOOKABILITY`, `WORDSPAN`, `DIDA`, `OPTIMIZATION`, `MULTI TICKETS`).
- Use a **colon and space** after the prefix.
- For investigations without a fix yet, mirror existing patterns: `(Investigation Pending) SOURCE: …`
- Keep the part after the colon specific (symptom or desired outcome), not vague.

Before finalizing a title, use the **Deduplication and related cards** pass above; among non-duplicates, align wording with existing titles on the same **source or topic**.

## Description templates (copy structure)

**Always keep the description body short.** The **entire** description (before the AI footer) must use **only these two sections**, in this order—**no** extra `⊙` headings, **no** multi-section “investigation” layouts, **no** exceptions:

1. `⊙ **Summary**`
2. `⊙ **Numbers/ quantity/ Examples:**`

Target shape (which **fields** to use, not how long the text must be): [#2676 DTT: Passenger type or count…](https://trello.com/c/2dEgDoSr/2676-dtt-passenger-type-or-count-does-not-match-error). For **tone and lean Numbers**, prefer [#2679 DTT: NDC-1348…](https://trello.com/c/tHozrWW3/2679-dtt-ndc-1348-invalidageforpaxtype-age-vs-ptc): **short Summary**, then **Scale** + **some examples** + **mongo_query:** (see below). For **several distinct error signatures on the same flow** (e.g. multiple `Response` patterns), prefer [#2677 DTT: VerifyPrice errors](https://trello.com/c/n0x26K2m/2677-dtt-verifyprice-errors): repeat one **example block per signature**—do not mash unrelated regexes into a single list without separating them.

Put anything that would have been “Describe the situation”, investigation narrative, repro steps, QA notes, or proposed solutions **inside** `⊙ **Numbers/ quantity/ Examples:**` as **compact bullets**—do **not** add separate `⊙` blocks for those topics.

### `⊙ **Summary**`

- **Tone:** **human-readable and calm**—write like you are explaining the ticket to a teammate in one breath. Prefer **short sentences** and **everyday verbs** (*we get*, *it looks like*, *booking fails*) over dense stack-speak. **Do not** pack the Summary with acronyms (**PTC**, **NDC** field names, **HTTP** minutiae, “dated marketing segment”, long supplier quotes, or multi-clause technical one-liners). Name the **integration or flow** in plain words when it helps (e.g. “in **BookFlight**”, “on **Downtowntravel**”). One **error code or short phrase** is fine if it anchors the card.
- **Length:** often **1–3 sentences** (~**25–80 words**); use up to **2–5 sentences** (~**40–120 words**) only when the *what / where* truly needs it. No multi-line logs here.
- **Content:** answer *what fails*, *where* (which flow or integration), and *why we are tracking it* in plain language—**hypothesis-level** (“looks like we map X wrong on our side”) is OK; **proof** (permalink, query, histogram) stays in **Numbers/ Examples**.

```markdown
⊙ **Summary**

We get this error NDC-1348 INVALID_AGE_FOR_PAX_TYPE in BookFlight. It looks like we map the passenger age incorrectly on our side.
```

(Adjust names/codes to the actual card; keep this **density** unless the user asks for a more formal runbook style.)

### `⊙ **Numbers/ quantity/ Examples:**`

Default to a **lean** layout readers can scan in seconds. Put **heavy** detail (collection names, `context`, regex rationale, MySQL/Mongo correlation essays, histograms, long **Related** notes) here **only when the user requests it**—otherwise the **query + a few links** are enough.

**Prevalence / counts:** put totals in the **Scale** line only (e.g. log-line count and distinct `transaction_id` for the stated window). **Do not** add a separate prose runbook after **`mongo_query:`** explaining how to derive counts—no lines like “Scope (counts): reuse the same `$match`…”, “append `{ $count: … }`”, or “move the `date_added` window as needed.” Those instructions live in **`bookability_analysis`** and agent context, not on the card.

**Preferred order — card-level (optional one line, then one or more example blocks):**

1. **Scale** — **one short line**, plain language (optional if not measured yet). State **how often** and the **window** (and **distinct `transaction_id`** when you have it).  
   - Good: `Scale - 93 times in 30d; 39 distinct transaction_id in 30d`  
   - Avoid by default: long preambles in the Scale line—the **mongo_query** block encodes filters.
2. **Setup** (only when useful, one line): e.g. database **`ota`**, collection **`debug_logs`**, **`context`:** `…`; run pipelines in **mongosh** or **Compass** (`ISODate`).

**Per error signature (repeat this whole block for each distinct pattern — match [#2677](https://trello.com/c/n0x26K2m/2677-dtt-verifyprice-errors)):**

1. **Title line:** `**SOURCE_OR_CODE — Short label — example: debug log**` (e.g. `**325 — No available solution — example: debug log**`).
2. Blank line, then **`some examples`** on its own line.
3. Blank line, then **full permalinks** — one URL per line (`https://…/debug-logs/log-group/<transaction_id>#<log_id>`). Bullets are OK; plain lines match board style. Add more rows until the slice is representative; use **`mongo_query`** to harvest more when the card would get too long.
4. Blank line, then **`mongo_query:`** on its own line (this label; not “MongoDB Query” or a prose runbook).
5. **Fenced `javascript`** block: **full** aggregation — **`$match`** (`context`, `date_added` bounds, `Response` `$regex`) then **`$project`** (`transaction_id`, `log_id`, **`link`** via `$concat` with the same base URL as the examples) then **`$group`** into **`links`** (same shape as **`bookability_analysis`** → [Aggregation: harvest debug log permalinks](../bookability_analysis/SKILL.md#aggregation-harvest-debug-log-permalinks-mongosh--compass)). Swap only the **`$match`** for each signature.

**Single-signature cards** (e.g. [#2679](https://trello.com/c/tHozrWW3/2679-dtt-ndc-1348-invalidageforpaxtype-age-vs-ptc)): use **one** such block after **Scale**; **`some examples`** + **`mongo_query:`** is still the preferred labeling (you may omit the long `**… — example: debug log**` title if the card title already names the error—otherwise keep it for scanability).

**Counts / deduped permalinks:** agents use **`bookability_analysis`** (or DB tools) to compute prevalence, then **write the result in Scale**—do not paste “how to count” steps onto the card. For harvest pipelines, see the same skill’s permalink variants when retries inflate line count.

**Optional extras** (add only if useful; keep each to **one line**):

- **Breakdown** — e.g. parsed counts from `Response` (age vs PTC buckets).
- **Correlation** — e.g. `transaction_id` ↔ MySQL `search_hash` / `bookability_*`.
- **Related:** `[title](shortUrl)` — one line when dedup or scope needs it.
- **Second query** — e.g. MySQL or a second **`mongo_query:`** block; **at most two** fenced blocks per signature unless the user asks for more (multi-signature cards have **one pipeline per block**—that is OK).
- **`IN (...)` hash lists** — keep **verbatim** when they are evidence; do not trim.

If there are no examples yet, say so and still give **`mongo_query:`** (or **MySQL**) that finds cases.

**Where to pull queries from:** **`bookability_analysis`** (MySQL + **Mongo permalink harvest**); **`explore_tables`** / **`document_table`**; repo scripts (`scripts/mysql_query.py`, `scripts/clickhouse_query.py`, `scripts/mongo_query.py`). Keep runnable text **inside** this section.

some examples

https://reservations.voyagesalacarte.ca/debug-logs/log-group/…#…
https://reservations.voyagesalacarte.ca/debug-logs/log-group/…#…

mongo_query:

```javascript
[
  {
    $match: {
      context: "Downtowntravel::BookFlight",
      Response: { $regex: "INVALID_AGE_FOR_PAX_TYPE", $options: "i" },
      date_added: {
        $gte: ISODate("2026-04-01T00:00:00.000Z"),
        $lte: ISODate("2026-05-01T00:00:00.000Z")
      }
    }
  },
  {
    $project: {
      _id: 0,
      transaction_id: 1,
      log_id: { $toString: "$_id" },
      link: {
        $concat: [
          "https://reservations.voyagesalacarte.ca/debug-logs/log-group/",
          "$transaction_id",
          "#",
          { $toString: "$_id" }
        ]
      }
    }
  },
  {
    $group: {
      _id: null,
      links: { $push: "$link" }
    }
  },
  { $project: { _id: 0, links: 1 } }
]
```
````

(For **SQL**, use a clear one-line label such as **MySQL:** instead of **`mongo_query:`**.)

**Regex in `Response`:** prefer a short distinctive substring; escape `.` when literal. For **exact JSON tail** matches (e.g. `"message":"Failed to reprice"}` only), a **single-quoted** `$regex` in mongosh avoids brittle escaping, e.g. `$regex: '"message":"Failed to reprice"}'`.

## Mandatory fields (do not ship the card without these)

1. `⊙ **Summary**` — short paragraph as above: **plain language first** (always this heading, not `## Summary`).
2. `⊙ **Numbers/ quantity/ Examples:**` — **lean by default:** optional **Scale** + **one or more** blocks each with **`some examples`** (permalink lines) + **`mongo_query:`** fenced pipeline (or **MySQL:**); optional one-line extras only when needed; related-card line only when dedup requires it.
3. **AI attribution footer** — exact block at the end (see below).

## Team roles

See [`roles.md`](./roles.md) for the current mapping of team members to roles (developers, QA, analysts, ancillaries, post-ticketing, manual agent team). Consult it when suggesting an owner, reviewer, or `@mention` for a card. **Do not auto-assign members**—propose a person based on the role mapping and let the user confirm.

**Mandatory member — Filipp (delivery manager):** every card the agent **creates or updates must include Filipp as a member**. No exceptions. When creating a card, pass Filipp's member ID in `idMembers` on `add_card_to_list`; when updating, if he is not already on the card, add him via `update_card_details` (or the member-add tool). If Filipp's Trello member ID is not known yet, fetch the board members first (e.g. via `get_board_members` or the equivalent Trello MCP tool) and cache the ID for the session.

## Labels

After `get_board_labels` for this board, map the user’s intent to existing names, for example:

- **Bugs & Fixes** — defects, regressions, wrong fees, errors.
- **Optimization** — optimizer, routing, contestant eligibility, performance of flows.
- **New Integration** — new source or major integration slice.
- **Injection** — injection-related work.
- **Investigation / Assesment** — unclear root cause, assessment-first.

Use label **names** consistently with board practice; pass the correct label **IDs** to `add_card_to_list` / `update_card_details`.

## MCP workflow (minimal)

1. `set_active_board` with board `61d5cf784c6396541499e7ce`.
2. **New card:** run **Deduplication and related cards** fully. Only if not duplicate: `add_card_to_list` on **Backlog** (`6509c593087340dfdd332b0a`) with `name` per **Card title**, `description` = `⊙ **Summary**` + `⊙ **Numbers/ quantity/ Examples:**` + **AI footer**, optional `labels`.
3. **Structure reference:** field layout—[#2676](https://trello.com/c/2dEgDoSr/2676-dtt-passenger-type-or-count-does-not-match-error); **Summary + lean Numbers**—[#2679](https://trello.com/c/tHozrWW3/2679-dtt-ndc-1348-invalidageforpaxtype-age-vs-ptc); **multi-signature `some examples` + `mongo_query:`**—[#2677](https://trello.com/c/n0x26K2m/2677-dtt-verifyprice-errors). Optionally `get_card` (`includeMarkdown`: true) for layout—**do not copy private or unrelated content verbatim**.
4. **Edits:** `update_card_details` / `move_card` / checklist tools as needed. If the description gains substantial new scope, refresh `⊙ **Summary**` so it still matches the card.

## AI agent footer (required)

Append this as the **last lines** of every **description** the agent writes (new or updated), with no text after it:

```markdown
---

_Card description drafted/updated by an AI agent; please verify facts, IDs, and links._
```

## What not to do

- Do not create new cards outside **Backlog** unless the user explicitly asks.
- Do not skip the **deduplication** pass before creating a card.
- Do not ship a card (new or updated) **without Filipp** (delivery manager) as a member—no exceptions.
- Do not invent booking IDs, hashes, or log URLs.
- Do not **trim** real `IN (...)` hash lists, SQL filters, or Mongo bounds **inside Numbers/ Examples** just to shorten the card—those lists are often the reproducible slice.
- Do not omit `⊙ **Numbers/ quantity/ Examples:**` when there are examples, queries, or patterns—put them there (compact).
- Do not bury related-card context in a long standalone section; use **one or two bullets** under **Numbers/ Examples** unless the user asked for more.
- Do not omit `⊙ **Summary**` or replace it with only the card title.
- Do not write a **jargon-heavy Summary** (long technical sentences, stacked acronyms, supplier payload walkthroughs)—put that under **Numbers/ Examples** with permalinks and queries.
- Do not **pad Numbers/ Examples** with long **Scale** preambles, correlation essays, histograms, or extra mongosh tips when **Scale + some examples + mongo_query:** already reproduces the issue—add those only when they change decisions.
- Do not add **post-query runbook prose** after **`mongo_query:`** (e.g. “Scope (counts):”, “reuse the same `$match`”, “append `{ $count: … }`”, “distinct transactions”, “adjust `date_added`”)—put measured numbers in **Scale** instead; counting mechanics stay in skills, not on Trello.
- Do not **edit an existing card** the user pointed to as a **reference-only** example—unless they explicitly ask to update that card; create **new** content using the same style instead.
- Do not add extra description sections (`Describe the situation`, `What investigation was done`, `How to reproduce`, `Documentation`, `QA`, `Solution`, `## Summary` blocks, optimization-only multi-`⊙` layouts, etc.)—fold everything into the two allowed sections.
